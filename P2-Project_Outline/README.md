## Submission Instructions

### Overview
For the past few decades, court watchers have observed proceedings in criminal courts to determine disparities and provide accountability to judges’ actions. Until recently, all data was collected in narrative form on paper and in the past few years it has moved to entering information in Excel and other spreadsheet software. 

My capstone is an app that allows volunteers and staff to add, edit, and review court watching data in real time. It allows users and managers to query information regardless of where they are (dependent on permissions), provide validation to user entered data (to cut down on bad data entry), and do basic analyses (basic aggregation, counts, and trends over time) and display them in a real-time dashboard. It will speed up the process around the country for court watch programs and provide added capacity to smaller court watch programs.

### Features
1. User login with different types of users with different permissions: Volunteers can add data and edit data associated with their own account. They can’t see any other users’ data nor delete anything; Managers can review all volunteer data and edit and delete all data.
2. Managers can create custom fields and field types (int vs string) and constraints (lengths) to allow for new data types to be captured in the future.
3. Managers can download data in a csv file.
4. Have a dashboard page for each judge and overall court that can show trends and basic analyses (e.g., sums, averages).

### Technologies
1. Java
2. MySQL
3. SpringBoot
4. Thymeleaf
5. JavaScript and jQuery
6. Flot

### What I'll Have to Learn
How to allow name and put constraints around and field (e.g., name a field and assign it a type like integer or string);
JavaScript, jQuery, and the Flot library.
